# TriviaGame 
This game is the World History Trivia Game.  The player tests their knowledge of world history by answering multiple choice questions within a set time period.

## Design & Technology
* This is an interactive game for web browsers with countdown timer.
    * The user is provided with a multiple-choice quiz.
    * The goal is to answer all the questions correctly within the given amount of time.
    * The user can refresh the browser to take the quiz as many times as they would like.
    * The application dynamically updates the HTML using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML.
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap framework
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * jQuery Library

## What the project does
* The player tests their knowledge of world history by answering multiple choice questions within a set time period. 
* The game is started once the player clicks the Start button.  This starts countdown timer that is always displayed.
* The player can only select one answer per question. 
* Once the timer expires, the game ends.
* At game end, the player's score is displayed with the number of questions answered correctly, answered incorrectly, and unanswered.

## Challenges
* This was an exercise in program flow and control and managing the timer functions.
* The most difficult challenge was setting up the radio button quiz and having it render correctly on the page.
* Also scoring a multiple choice quiz took some trial and error.
